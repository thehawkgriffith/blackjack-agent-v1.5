# blackjack-agent-v1.5
Bug fixes and more frequent policy improvement steps as compared to the earlier version, haven't taken it down, for comparison purposes. Win rate increased to 42%, Optimum Policy converges well within 10,000 epochs, further increase shows no better results. Added a function to print the policy the agent uses, depending on a threshold value of how often a state is encountered, to reduce hectic policy printing for 500+ states. Experimenting on further improvements.
